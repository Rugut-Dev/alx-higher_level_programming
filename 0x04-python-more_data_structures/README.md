### General

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are sets and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them

* What are dictionaries and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries and how to use them
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate over a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Tasks

#### 0. Squared Simple

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

* Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
* matrix is a 2 dimensional array
* Returns a new matrix:
* Same size as matrix
* Each value should be the square of the value of the input
* Initial matrix should not be modified
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
